Encountering merge conflicts can impede the swift delivery of code, thereby obstructing the establishment and upkeep of an efficient DevOps workflow. DevOps aims to facilitate a rapid process for releasing incremental code changes. Therefore, implementing a structured branching strategy can alleviate this challenge, enabling developers to collaborate seamlessly and minimize conflicts. This approach fosters parallel workstreams within teams, promoting quicker releases and reduced likelihood of conflicts through a well-defined process for source control modifications.
